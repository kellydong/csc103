/* TODO: write a function called "push_front(V,x)" for a vector, which
 * adds parameter x to index 0 of vector V by moving all the other values
 * to higher indexes. */
/* TODO: Try to finish / reproduce the exercises we did in lecture:
 * (1) write a function that reverses the order of the elements of
 * a vector given as input.  It should have void return type and reverse
 * the vector given as the parameter.
 * (2) write binary search, if you haven't already.
 * NOTE: for binary search, make sure you understand why we used a
 * const by-reference parameter in lecture. */
